My project is called "typewriter". It simulates a classic mechanical typewriter--an olivetti lettra 22. It uses a simulated olivetti truetype font along with real audio samples of the model in action. The concept is really an interactive toy more than anything else. In essense, you can type on your keyboard and experience the auditory and visual senses of the classic typewriter. A certain times, you're limited in the speed at which you type due to the keystriking action. You also realize that you can't delete your mistakes (some we take forgranted nowadays)!

For me, this concept is a baseline, a starting point for additional possibilities such as a fun way to post status updates to a social network such as twitter or facebook, or anything else that's fun or gamelike (such as a way to measure your typing speed, sending your resulting text in morse code, etc.). It was a really good exercise in learning what's involved in preparing the assets (graphics, sounds and other elements) and then understaning the coding principles of synchronizing user input, animation and sound. I noticed how quickly the code got unmangeable. (A future rev should include refactoring the components into their own java classes.)

It's currently running on Java desktop only (unfortunately). I haven't had time to troubleshoot my Javascript port. The source code is available at Github here: https://github.com/ewoo/typewriter 

Note that the image above shows the app running in debug mode.
