typewriter
==========

A Processing sketch created for a coursera.org class. (See it in action [here](https://rawgithub.com/ewoo/typewriter/master/typewriterjs/web-export/index.html))

My project is called "typewriter". It simulates a classic mechanical typewriter--an olivetti lettra 22. It uses a simulated olivetti truetype font along with real audio samples of the model in action. The concept is really an interactive toy more than anything else. In essense, you can type on your keyboard and experience the auditory and visual senses of the classic typewriter. A certain times, you're limited in the speed at which you type due to the keystriking action. You also realize that you can't delete your mistakes (something we take forgranted nowadays)!

For me, this concept is a baseline, a starting point for additional possibilities such as a fun way to post status updates to a social network such as twitter or facebook, or anything else that's fun or gamelike (such as a way to measure your typing speed, sending your resulting text in morse code, etc.). It was an enjoyable and befitting exercise in learning what's involved in putting together an interactive piece: preparing the multimedia assets (optimizing graphics, splicing sounds and other elements) and then understanding the coding principles of synchronizing user input, animation and sound in realtime. I noticed how quickly the code got unmangeable! (A future rev should include refactoring the components into their own classes with more encapsulation.)

For look & feel, I opted for a clean gray-scaled look to the piece--and purposely tried to downplay the skeuomorphism. (This seems to be the design idiom many Processing sketches follow.) However, I did need to keep the texture of the paper such that the page animation would be noticeable.

Note that the image above shows the app running in debug mode.
